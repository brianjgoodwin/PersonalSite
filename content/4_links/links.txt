Introtext:

I’m a bumpkin from a small town, and I’ve learned so much by reading interesting things online. I was in college during the peak of the blogging era, and I spent hours following blogrolls all over the internet finding new perspectives and interests.

So here are my favorite sites and newsletters. There are no affiliate links or anything like that. I just like these websites and writers and think you should read them.
