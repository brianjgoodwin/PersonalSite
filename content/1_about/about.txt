Hi, I’m Brian. I'm a regular dude. Not really. I'm about to say that a computer changed my life. Buckle up.

Technology has been a part of my life from a very young. My first computer was an Apple Macintosh SE/30. That little toaster box computer changed my life, shooting a sense of wonder, curiosity, and power through my little brain like lighting. I was a decent, but unremarkable math student as a child. I earned a Bachelor's degree from the University of Michigan in 2009, dual concentrations in English Language & Literature and History of Art. I spent my 20s working a number of very interesting but poorly-paid jobs and taking self-paced online courses in technology and computer science after work. And having adventures and growing up and looking at art. I've spent my 30s working in the non-profit sector. I query databases for a living. And that's about all I'll say about work on the internet, a policy that has served me well so far in life. I'll be 40 this year. Outside of work, I do a lot of stuff with computers. And art. And computer-art. And fitness. 

If you're on this site, you either know me in real life or you want to know more about me. This is where I post about my interests and talk about things I'm making (past, present, and future tenses). It's also a bit of special interest - technology has been a big part of my life and career. 

## Social Media
I am not active on social media, by which I mean any Meta-owned service or X, formerly known as Twitter. I am not accepting (or even seeing, in most cases) new friend requests. I still control my accounts but they are dormant.
